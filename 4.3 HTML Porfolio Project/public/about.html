<h1> 👋 About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Hello! I'm Tanmay Yadav, a passionate and curious Computer Science undergraduate with a love for building impactful technology through Data Science, Machine Learning, and Web Development.</h2>

<h3>I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech and have completed a hands-on summer internship at Upflaire, where I worked on real-world data science applications — from developing a stock price prediction dashboard to deploying a spam email classifier using Flask, and even creating an interactive storytelling app with Generative AI.</h3>
<hr/>
<h2>🚀 What I Do</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>I thrive at the intersection of code and creativity. My projects aim to solve real-life problems using tools like:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>🐍 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib</li>
 <li>🤖 Scikit-learn, Machine Learning models</li>
<li> 🌐 Flask, Streamlit for full-stack development</li>
<li> 🗃️ SQLite, GitHub, and APIs for integration and deployment</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2>Some highlights include:</h2>
<hr/>
<ul>
 <li>📈 Laptop and Stock Price Prediction using regression models</li>
 <li>📬 Spam Email Classification using Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer</li>
<li> 🧠 AI-generated storytelling platform with Google Generative AI</li>
<li> 🌦️ Real-time Weather App and Crop Suggestion Tool for farmers</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>💡 My Approach</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I believe in learning by building, sharing knowledge, and staying updated with modern tools and frameworks. Whether it’s through a course  , I always aim to grow with the community.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I’m either hitting the gym,  or reading about productivity and wellness. I value discipline, creativity, and real-world application over just theory.</p>
